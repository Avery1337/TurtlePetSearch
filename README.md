This is a addon to search through your companion spellbook on Turtle WoW.  Simply open up your spellbook and type in the search bar at the top.  There is a Result Counter to the left of the search bar to see how many pets you are cycling through.

The Titles Button to the left of the Result Counter will show an interface that tells you how many of each pet you have aquired and what is still needed for each pet title.
